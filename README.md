## This project implements a *Sonar Radar System* using an Arduino and an ultrasonic sensor to detect Aerial threats within a specific range. The system simulates radar functionality by using the sensor to send and receive signals, then visualizing the data on a display or software interface (such as Processing) to represent object distances in real-time.

## Features
- *Radar-like Visualization*: Displays the detected objects in a radar-like format.
- *Real-time Distance Measurement*: Continuously updates the distance to the nearest object in its path.

## Components Used
- *Arduino Uno
- *Ultrasonic Sensor (HC-SR04)*
- *Servo Motor* (for rotating the sensor to simulate radar sweeping)
- *Processing (optional)* for visual display
- Jumper wires
- Breadboard
- USB cable for power and data transfer.
